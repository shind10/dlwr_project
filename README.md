Deep Learning With R - Final project
  
  - Data type : images
  - Link to data source : [Kannada-MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/c/Kannada-MNIST/data)
  - Problem type : Multiclass classification
  - Proposed network architecture : CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks)
  - Participants : Atika F. Urmi, Dongho Shin
  - Description : The goal of this project is to try&provide little bit extension to "digit recognizer" that covered in textbook. Instead of Arabic numbers, recently-released dataset of Kannada digits is used. By performing this project, we will practice and enhance our knowledge in Computer vision fundamentals in deep learning including simple neural networks and classification methods.
